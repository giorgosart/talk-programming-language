# Talk Language REPL - Developer Guide

This document provides information for developers working on the Talk Programming Language REPL implementation.

## Overview

The Talk REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) implementation provides an interactive environment for users to enter Talk instructions one line at a time and see immediate results. It maintains context between commands and provides user-friendly error feedback.

## Class Structure

### TalkRepl

The main class `TalkRepl` in `talk.core` package implements the interactive loop. Key components:

- **RuntimeContext**: Maintains variables and function definitions across commands
- **InstructionExecutor**: Executes Talk instructions within the context
- **ExpressionResolver**: Evaluates Talk expressions
- **Command History**: Tracks previously entered commands

## Implementation Details

### Command Processing Flow

1. **Read**: Get user input from the console
2. **Process**: 
   - Check for special commands (help, exit, etc.)
   - Add to history if not a special command
3. **Evaluate**:
   - Tokenize the input
   - Differentiate between expressions and instructions
   - Parse instructions or evaluate expressions
4. **Print**:
   - Format and display results
   - Show errors with context if needed
5. **Loop**: Continue the process

### Special Commands

The REPL implements several special commands:
- `exit`, `quit`: End the session
- `help`: Display help information
- `history`: Show command history
- `clear`: Clear command history

### Testing

The REPL implementation includes specialized testing hooks:
- `setReaderForTesting`: Inject a custom reader for tests
- `setResolverForTesting`: Inject a custom expression evaluator
- `setExecutorForTesting`: Inject a custom instruction executor
- `evaluateAndPrintForTesting`: Directly test the evaluation logic

## Enhanced REPL with JLine

The enhanced version of the REPL (`JLineEnabledRepl`) adds support for advanced terminal features:

### JLine Integration

The REPL now integrates with JLine 3 to provide:
- Arrow key navigation of command history
- Tab completion for keywords and variables
- History search using Ctrl+R
- Line editing capabilities
- Persistent history between sessions

### Key Components

1. **LineReader**: Handles input with history navigation
2. **Terminal**: Manages the terminal interface
3. **TalkCompleter**: Provides completions for Talk keywords and variables
4. **DefaultHistory**: Manages command history with persistence

### Implementation Details

The enhanced REPL implementation:
1. Creates a JLine terminal
2. Sets up LineReader with appropriate options
3. Handles special key combinations (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D)
4. Provides colored output for errors and help text
5. Stores history in ~/.talk_history

### Fallback Mechanism

If JLine initialization fails, the enhanced REPL will fall back to standard input mode with a warning message.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. ✓ **Command History Navigation** (IMPLEMENTED)
   - ✓ Arrow key navigation for command history
   - ✓ Implement command history persistence between sessions

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - More descriptive error messages
   - Context-aware suggestions for fixing errors
   - Line highlighting for errors

3. **Advanced Features**
   - ✓ Tab completion for variables and keywords (IMPLEMENTED)
   - Multiline input support
   - Rich output formatting
   - Session saving/loading

For enhanced error handling:
1. Extend error classes to include more context
2. Create specialized handlers for different error types
3. Implement suggestion algorithm based on common mistakes

## Integration Points

The REPL integrates with:
- **TalkRunner**: Command-line entry point that launches the REPL
- **InstructionExecutor**: Executes parsed instructions
- **RuntimeContext**: Maintains state across commands
- **ExpressionResolver**: Evaluates expressions

## Debugging the REPL

When debugging REPL issues:

1. Check the execution context for variable state
2. Examine the tokenization process for parsing errors
3. Test expression evaluation separately from instruction execution
4. Verify history management and command handling logic

## Testing Guide

To properly test the REPL:

1. Unit test each component with mocked dependencies
2. Create integration tests that simulate user input sequences
3. Test error conditions and recovery
4. Verify state persistence across multiple commands

Example test patterns are available in `TalkReplTest.java`.
