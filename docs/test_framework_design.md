# Testing Framework Design for Talk Programming Language

## Overview

The Talk Programming Language testing framework will allow users to create self-testing scripts with built-in assertions. The framework will focus on simplicity and natural language expressions, consistent with the Talk language philosophy.

## Test Syntax

### Basic Assertion

```talk
expect result of <expression> to be <expected_value>
```

Example:
```talk
set x to 5
expect result of x + 5 to be 10
```

### Other Assertion Types

```talk
expect result of <expression> to equal <expected_value>
expect result of <expression> to be greater than <value>
expect result of <expression> to be less than <value>
expect result of <expression> to contain <substring_or_element>
```

### Test Organization

Tests can be organized into test blocks:

```talk
test "Description of test group"
    # Test code and assertions here
    expect result of function_call with arg1 and arg2 to be "expected result"
```

### Test Setup and Teardown

```talk
before each test
    # Setup code that runs before each test
    set counter to 0

after each test
    # Cleanup code that runs after each test
    delete file "temp_data.txt"
```

## Execution Model

1. Tests are executed in the order they appear in the script
2. Test results are collected during execution
3. A summary is displayed at the end of execution
4. The script will exit with code 0 if all tests pass, 1 otherwise

## CLI Integration

```
talk test <file.talk>
```

Output:
```
Running tests in test_script.talk...
✓ Test group 1: Description
  ✓ Assertion 1 passed
  ✓ Assertion 2 passed
✓ Test group 2: Another description
  ✓ Assertion 1 passed
  ✗ Assertion 2 failed: Expected 10, got 9

Test summary: 4/5 passed (1 failed)
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Add tokenizer support for new test keywords
2. Create new instruction types for test assertions and blocks
3. Modify runtime to collect test results
4. Add reporting mechanisms for test outcomes
5. Update CLI to support test running mode
