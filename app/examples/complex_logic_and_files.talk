# Complex Logic and File Operations Example

create file as "results.txt"
variable x equal 5
variable y equal 10

if x is greater than 3 AND y is smaller than 20 OR x is equal to 5 then
    write "Complex logic true" in results.txt
otherwise
    write "Complex logic false" in results.txt

repeat 3 times
    write _index in results.txt

if file results.txt is not empty then
    write "File has content" in results.txt
