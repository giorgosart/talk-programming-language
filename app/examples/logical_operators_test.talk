# Comparison operators test
set a to 5
set b to 10
set c to 5

# Basic comparison operators
if a is equal to 5 then
    write "a is equal to 5"

if a is not equal to b then
    write "a is not equal to b"

if b is greater than a then
    write "b is greater than a"

if a is smaller than b then
    write "a is smaller than b"

# Logical operators with comparisons
if a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "a is 5 AND b is 10"

if a is equal to c and b is greater than 10 or a is smaller than 3 then
    write "Complex condition evaluated to true"

if not a is equal to b then
    write "a is NOT equal to b"

# Nested if statements with logical operators
if a is equal to 5 then
    if b is greater than 8 then
        write "Nested condition: a is 5 and b is greater than 8"
    if b is smaller than 15 then
        write "Nested condition: a is 5 and b is smaller than 15"

# Multiple logical operators
if a is equal to 5 and b is greater than 8 and c is equal to 5 then
    write "All three conditions are true"

if a is equal to 6 or a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "Complex precedence test"
