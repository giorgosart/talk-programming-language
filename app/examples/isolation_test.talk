# Simple test to isolate the issue
set a to 5
set b to 10

# Test 1: Basic if statement
if a is equal to 5 then
    write "Basic condition works"

# Test 2: If statement with a logical operator 
if a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "Logical AND works"

# Test 3: Nested if statements
if a is equal to 5 then
    if b is equal to 10 then
        write "Nested conditions work"
