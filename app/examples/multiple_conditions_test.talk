# Test with multiple conditions
set a to 5
set b to 10
set c to 5

# Basic comparison operators
if a is not equal to b then
    write "a is not equal to b"

if b is greater than a then
    write "b is greater than a"

# Logical operators with comparisons
if a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "a is 5 AND b is 10"
