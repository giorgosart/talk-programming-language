# Part 2 of logical operators test
set a to 5
set b to 10
set c to 5

# Logical operators with comparisons
if a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "a is 5 AND b is 10"

if a is equal to c and b is greater than 10 or a is smaller than 3 then
    write "Complex condition evaluated to true"

if not a is equal to b then
    write "a is NOT equal to b"
