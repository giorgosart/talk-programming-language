# Part 1 of logical operators test
set a to 5
set b to 10
set c to 5

# Basic comparison operators
if a is equal to 5 then
    write "a is equal to 5"

if a is not equal to b then
    write "a is not equal to b"

if b is greater than a then
    write "b is greater than a"

if a is smaller than b then
    write "a is smaller than b"
