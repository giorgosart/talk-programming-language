# Minimal test for logical operators and indented write statements
set a to 5
set b to 10

# Basic test
if a is equal to 5 then
    write "a equals 5"

# Testing logical AND
if a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "Logical AND works"
    
# Testing logical OR
if a is equal to 6 or b is equal to 10 then
    write "Logical OR works"
    
# Testing logical NOT
if not a is equal to b then
    write "Logical NOT works"
