# Full logical operators test
set a to 5
set b to 10
set c to 5

# Basic comparisons
if a is equal to 5 then
    write "a is 5"

if a is not equal to b then
    write "a is not equal to b"

# Logical operators
if a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 10 then
    write "a is 5 AND b is 10"

if a is equal to 6 or a is equal to 5 then
    write "a is 6 OR a is 5"

if not a is equal to b then
    write "a is NOT equal to b"

# Complex logical expressions
if (a is equal to 5 and b is greater than 8 and c is equal to 5) then
    write "Complex condition true"
